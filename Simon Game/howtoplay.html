        <h2>How to Play Simon Game</h2>
<div>
    <b>1. Game Setup:</b> The Simon game features a series of colored buttons, typically arranged in a circular pattern. There's also a central console that controls the game.
</div>
<div>
    <b>2. Players:</b> There is one player in the Simon game. The game itself acts as the opposing player, displaying sequences of colors and sounds that the player must remember and repeat.
</div>
<div>
    <b>3. Gameplay:</b> The game begins with Simon displaying a sequence of colors or sounds using the colored buttons. The player's task is to mimic the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order.
</div>
<div>
    <b>4. Memory Challenge:</b> Each successful repetition of the sequence results in Simon adding one more step to the pattern. The player must remember the entire sequence correctly to continue.
</div>
<div>
    <b>5. Winning Conditions:</b> The player wins by correctly repeating the increasingly complex sequence set by Simon. The game ends if the player successfully repeats a long enough sequence or if they make a mistake.
</div>
<div>
    <b>6. Mistakes:</b> If the player presses the wrong button or fails to repeat the sequence accurately, Simon signals the mistake, and the game may end or give the player another chance to try.
</div>
<div>
    <b>7. Game Over:</b> The game is over when the player either successfully completes a very long sequence or makes a mistake. To play again, simply restart the game and challenge yourself to beat your previous score.
</div>
Enjoy the challenge of Simon, where memory and concentration are your greatest assets!
